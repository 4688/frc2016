# FRC 2016
> Saints Bot (team 4688) robot code for FRC 2016.

### About our robot  
Our robot, nicknamed Lo Rida (as in &ldquo;Low Rider&rdquo;) was a fairly
compact and fast robot that focused on clearing courtyard defenses. We were
successful at achieving top 8 in qualifier matches out of 52 teams and made it
to the quarter finals, where we were ultimately beaten out.

### Wait, Python? On an FRC robot?
Yup. We made use of the [robotpy library](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib).
It emulates the entire WPIlib API written in pure Python. Part of the reason
that we're making our robot source code available is that robotpy is still
fairly obscure, so we wanted to make some examples of application available for
other people interested in using the library.

### Running the code
If you'd like to test how certain pieces of code interact with the hardware
components, our valuable team member Matt Brockman put together a concise
electrical schematic diagram, included in the **schematic.pdf** file. Note that
changes made during competition are not reflected in the schematic diagram, but
that shouldn't be a problem, as the modifications were purely mechanical and had
little if not nothing to do with wiring.
